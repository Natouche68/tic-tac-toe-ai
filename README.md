# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a simple program that lets you play tic-tac-toe against an AI.

I used the Minimax algorithm to make the AI.

## How to play

For now, there is no compiled binary. You need to download the source code and use Deno to run it.

```bash
deno task start

# If you want to watch for changes
deno task dev
```
